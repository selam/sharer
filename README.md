Sharer, sends images from gmail attachments to imgur with anonymously

# Why? 

When i want to share my photos with world, i send these photos to my gmail account, download and upload to imgur, when you do that every week, but it's boring process, so i thought why i don't create an extension for that.  also you can send any photo you received from your friends.
